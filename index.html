    <h4 class='center' style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Bio</strong></h4>

    <p class='center'>
       Formed 1995, Houston, TX, United States. The band was discovered by former Kid Rock manager Michael Rand<br>
       performing at the Pappadeaux Cafe in Houston in 1998. His agency proceeded to book over 350 dates on the group<br>
       unsigned. Extensive publicity and artist development was regimented. This work eventually led to Michael<br>
       bringing the band to Universal Music Group CEO Doug Morris under the direction of long time A&R rep Reen<br>
       Nalli. The group moved to San Marcos, Texas in December 1996 and were signed to Universal Records in 1999.

       Managed by Justin and Jeremy's parents under the name RoDan Entertainment, Blue October released their first<br>
       album, The Answers, in 1998; a well-received debut which sold over 5,000 copies in Houston alone. Due to a<br>
       fan-based connection with ABC's KTRK-TV (Channel 13), Blue October was able to schedule an early-morning<br>
       news performance â€“ the band's first live television performance. Other unreleased songs from this period, such as<br>
       "Rust", "Colorado 5591", "His Name Is Crazy", "Gun Metal Blue", "Dollar 30F Gravy", and "5 Day Walk" can be<br>
       found on YouTube.

       Blue October caught the attention of the major record labels while working with producer dB (Don Byczynski) in<br>
       early 1998. Pre-production started for getting Blue October a more "radio ready" sound, with new songs and to<br>
       rewrite material off The Answers. Tracking was done in a studio setup at Justin's home in San Marcos, Texas. The<br>
       recordings were sent to Universal, then in 1999 Blue October signed to Universal Records for the release of their<br>
       second album, Consent to Treatment. The band was dropped by Universal Records in 2000.

       After being dropped, the band recruited new guitarist C.B. Hudson and got back on the road. In November 2002<br>
       the band signed with Texas-based management company Rainmaker Artists. Rainmaker immediately signed to<br>
       their record label. Just before entering the studio Matt Noveskey left the band for personal reasons. The remaining<br>
       band members persevered on, entering the studio to record what would be become their third album History for<br>
       Sale. The first single from History For Sale was "Calling You" released in February 2003. On March 20, 2003<br>
       radio station "102.1 the EDGE" in Dallas added "Calling You" to regular rotation, and it began to spread to radio<br>
       stations across the country receiving over 56,585 spins on the US airwaves. Rainmaker took the band to New York<br>
       where the band played multiple live showcases over a week period in early May 2003 for Atlantic Records,<br>
       Columbia Records and Universal Records. Blue October was then offered records deals by each company.<br>
       Ultimately the band returned to Universal Republic Records in May 2003. History for Sale was then re-released<br>
       on Universal Republic in August 2003. History for Sale was largely a response to the control Universal had placed<br>
       on the group during the Consent to Treatment production process. This is evident in songs such as "Somebody" and<br>
       "Inner Glow". "Calling You" remained the group's largest mainstream success until their 2006 single, "Hate Me".<br>
       The band has had eleven Top 40 singles over their past seven studio albums and is best known for their platinum<br>
       singles "Hate Me" and "Into the Ocean" from their 2006 platinum album Foiled.
